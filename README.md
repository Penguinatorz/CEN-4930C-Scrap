# CEN-4930C-Scrapp

This program started on 10/19/21
I have little to no knowledge of python and how scrapping works; however, I did went through youtube videos and a bit of lecture and reading on how to do so.
I am guided by such and will show my progress as a timeline of sorts in here.

A lot of the files shown here were examples done and practices through the usage of youtube video for my knowledge.

The main scrapper file is the amazonScrapper.py
